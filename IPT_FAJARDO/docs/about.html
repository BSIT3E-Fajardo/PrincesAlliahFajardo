                        <p> Skills and Expertise<br></br>
                            I am skillful in video editing, where I bring stories to life through visually compelling edits. I am also proficient in digital animation, crafting smooth and dynamic visuals with attention to detail. With a talent for traditional drawing, I create expressive sketches and illustrations, and my creativity shines in developing engaging storylines and storyboards that resonate with audiences. 
                            <br></br>Goals and Vision<br></br>
                            My ultimate goal is to become a professional multimedia artist. I aspire to combine technology and creativity to produce impactful and inspiring works that connect with people and leave a lasting impression.
                            <br></br> Experiences <br></br>
                             I have gained valuable experience as a scriptwriter and video editor for PAMANA TV, where I honed my storytelling and production skills. I also had the opportunity to host for PAMANA TV, enhancing my confidence and public speaking abilities. Additionally, I have worked as a storyboard artist, creating visual concepts to bring ideas to life effectively. </p> </div>
